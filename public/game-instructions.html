            The object of Peg Solitaire is to finish the game with only one peg remaining on the board,
            preferably in the centre hole. You can remove a peg by jumping over it with another peg.
            Only certain jumps are legal: you must jump horizontally or vertically, and you can jump
            only one peg at a time.
